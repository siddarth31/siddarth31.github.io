<!-- This is some information about me.-->
Siddarth is a Principal Research Scientist at <a href='https://www.merl.com/'>Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL)</a>. His research spans computer vision, machine learning, and robotics, with a focus on enabling autonomous systems to perceive, understand, and act in the physical world. He develops data-driven and geometric approaches for learning, perception, manipulation, and decision-making, with applications in human–robot collaboration and real-world automation. He also serves as an Associate Editor for <a href='https://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/ra-l/'>IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</a>.

He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from <a href='https://www.northwestern.edu/'>Northwestern University</a> in 2019. In collaboration with the <a href='https://www.sralab.org/'>Shirley Ryan AbilityLab</a>, his research focused on probabilistic human intent recognition and adaptive assistance in shared-autonomy for robot teleoperation, involving interactive assistive systems and user studies. He also developed perception algorithms to infer goals for navigation and robotic manipulation.
